# Olympics DB

For the purposes of the course Databases (9th semester), as a team, we had to develop a relational database. Data demands, user categories and privileges are reported. Based on the Chen's notation, we construct the E/R Diagram of the database and consequently its Relational Model, including the required constraints. Lastly, we define some typical views and queries (in both relational algebra and SQL language) in order to accent the functionality of our database.

For the database implementation we use MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE.

Me and my team, decided to develop a database that meets the Olympic Games' needs.
